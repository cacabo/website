<p>I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that this year was <i>quick</i>. By that, I mean truly scarily and excitingly quick. To give some context, I recently completed my sophomore year at Penn. Many people are quick to remind me that I am now halfway done with college. For the record, there's no need to remind me or any of my peers--we are well aware.</p>

<p>Time is an incredibly valuable resource, but so too are things that you can derive directly in exchange for time. We complete time-based transactions all the time, be they for percentage points on tests, better grades on assignments, learning, money, mentorship, a more relaxed mind, a healthier body, stronger relationships...</p>

<p>In order to have gotten to where each of us is today, we required some level of time management. I prefer the term <i>time optimization</i> because it gets to the root of our asiprations: we have limited time and, as a result, in everything we do we should aim to make the most of it.</p>

<p>Such optimization is unique to each person and requires much introspection and personal-pep talks to improve, so I won't touch on that. Rather, I want to discuss some interesting facets of time and what we can do to make the most of these aspects.</p>

<p>In terms of <i>perceived duration</i>, a minute on the treadmill is not equal to a minute relaxing on the beach. Likewise, a precise minute five years ago is not equal to a minute right now. This is to say, time is at once quite fluid and rigid; it is absolutely consistent in its passing though absolutely inconsistent in its impact on us. It follows that different ways of divvying up our time will lead to different perceptions of that very same time.</p>

<h4 class="bold">A pitch for consistency</h4>

<p>I love being consistent. There's a certain freedom to preparedness: complete your assignments before they are due and you have time to explore new avenues. Be proactive and productive at work and you have time to learn more from others and exceed expectations. Do this consistently and you set a tone of efficiency and efficacy day-in and day-out.</p>

<p>To test this, I've maintained some personal analytics over this past year to install more consistency in my day-to-day routing (warning, a little nerd is about to come out).</p>

<p>For starters, I want to continually get better at building technical products. To this aim, I've sought to commit as many days as possible over the past year. Similarly, I wanted to get stronger and generally healthier. Since January first, I've exercised all but 19 days and have kept to a consistent cycle of working out different muscle groups. In both cases, consistency has proven a sure means of gleaning desired results.</p>

<p>There is an enforced amount of consistency in any collegaite or professional setting: there are weekly deliverables, set meeting times, and delineated expectations. Ensuring that you are making consistent progress on top of this, be it in software, fitness, or any other pursuit, is central to maximizing learning and growth.</p>

<p>Having established this glowing upside, I now want to touch on some apparent negatives of absolute consistency.</p>

<h4 class="bold">The qualification of cyclicity</h4>

<p>To be quite honest, I didn't know this was a word until I started writing this, hoped that it was a word, and consulted Google for affirmation (<i><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cyclicity">Cyclicity:</a> n., the quality or state of being cyclic</i>). Daily routines are often conducive to setting the tone for productivity: get in, get tasks done, and move on. But there is a caveat to this: we can get trapped in these daily routines and they can limit us from experiencing the incredible variety that life and our world have the capacities to present.</p>

<p>This line is often crossed in college where your weekly calendar of classes, assignments, and meetings is inherently repetitive and incredibly demanding. At times, and depending on your approach to this repetition, routines can succumb to monotony. As humans we fail to learn or enjoy as much when in monotonous situations. We like dynamism, excitation, and using our brains in new and challenging situations.</p>

<p>I claim consistency is great for building expectations, though cyclicity is the bane of personal progress.</p>

<h4 class="bold">Integrating dynamism into your daily routine</h4>

<p>Many who know me well know that I'm a relatively spontaneous guy. Yesterday, for example, I convinced my roommates to help attempt to string my hammock from our third-story balcony to a tree (due to safety concerns, we lowered our standards and instead positioned it about a story high between two trees; still cool--really, really cool). This is because I find myself most excited when I'm exploring new concepts, places, and actions. In these sitautions I'm exposed to new things and feel as if I grow through these unique experiences.</p>

<p>When lost in a daily cycle, it's all too easy to forgo any semblence of spontanaety, deferring instead for the accepted, regular, and pervasive.</p>
